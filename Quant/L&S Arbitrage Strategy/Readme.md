## L&S Strategy
This repository contains a demonstration of a quantitative spread trading strategy based on mean-reversion principles and Bollinger Bands. The code automates the process of selecting a highly correlated stock pair from a given list, computes their price spread, and applies a simple set of buy/sell rules based on the spread’s position relative to its Bollinger Bands, with basic take-profit and stop-loss conditions.

It is important to note that this implementation is not designed to generate investment alpha or function as a real hedge. Despite encouraging backtest results, the strategy does not account for real market factors such as trading costs, liquidity, slippage, or portfolio and risk constraints. The main value lies in illustrating market relationships and systematic analysis rather than in delivering a deployable investment solution. Users are encouraged to experiment further by adjusting parameters, trying alternative pairs, or applying new filters. 

**With further development, this framework may serve as a starting point for more sophisticated market research or strategy prototyping, but it is not suitable for actual trading as presented.**
