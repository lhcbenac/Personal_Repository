##COLAB NOTEBOOK

The Market Neutral strategy here avoids the top 100 S&P 500 stocks and randomly selects from the rest, with the goal of neutralizing market direction by daily ranking returns and equally dividing positions into long and short allocations. Allocation and rankings are updated dynamically every day and do not consider historical price, only the previous day's status. This approach provides valuable insight into market structure and dynamic portfolio management, but is not a trading recommendation. Users can further explore by changing parameters, stock universes, or trying other ranking methods such as volume or market cap. This code is a flexible research template, not production-ready for actual trading.
