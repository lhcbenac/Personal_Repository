This repository presents a dynamic market neutral investment strategy implemented in Python, targeting a diversified universe of US equities. The strategy systematically ranks stock returns on a daily basis, dynamically rebalances long and short positions, and enforces minimum and maximum single-asset exposures to maintain broad diversification and reduce risk concentration. Portfolio weights are adjusted each day according to the updated ranking. The primary goal is to achieve dollar neutrality, with equal allocation to long and short sides so the portfolio performance is independent from the overall market direction.

The code also fetches and aligns the S&P 500 index, allowing direct comparison of strategy performance with the benchmark. The results show this approach maintains competitive cumulative returns and beats the S&P 500 on most trading days within the sample period, despite occasional periods of lag or drawdown.

Market neutral strategies like this can be applied to stock baskets, sector portfolios, or even international assets, wherever relative price movements can be systematically ranked and tracked. This implementation is illustrative, showing how to create, rebalance, and evaluate a dollar-neutral strategy with clear constraints and daily re-ranking. The method’s flexibility enables further research in risk management, alternative ranking signals, and real-world portfolio optimization.
